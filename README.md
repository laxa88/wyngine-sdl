## Setup

### Windows Desktop

Check `.vscode` and `Makefile` settings, modify accordingly to setup your build workflow.

- In your current active window (e.g. `main.cpp`), press `CTRL + SHIFT + B` to build.
- Press `F5` to build and debug.
- Include `libpng16-16.dll` in your output folder.

### Mac OSX

- Use brew: `brew update` > `brew upgrade`
- Install GCC: `brew install gcc`
- Install SDL2: `brew install sdl2`
- Install SDL2 image: `brew install sdl2_image`
- Build: `g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -o main -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image`

Note: Use `brew` to take advantage of the default directory, i.e. `/usr/local/lib`

### Web / HTML5 (Windows)

- Install emscripten
- Open `emcmdprompt.bat` (which contains `emcc` command) from installation folder
- Build: `emcc main.cpp -O3 -s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 --preload-file img -o bin-js/webgame.html`
